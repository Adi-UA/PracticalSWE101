# Homework Assignment 3

## Section 1: Practice Tracing Recursion

### Instructions

In the `hw6a.py` file provided, you will find a series of recursive functions. Your task is to trace the execution of each function for a given input and determine the output. the functions are already implemented and some print statements have ben added to help you trace the execution.

You do not need to actually turn in the traced output. This is a practice exercise to help you understand how recursion works and how functions are executed in a recursive manner. You can run the script to see the output and compare it with your own tracing.

## Section 2: Mini Assignment

Let's tie everything we've learned together by working on a practical example. This is also your mini assignment, so don't read the code section unless you want spoilers! Write the code in a file named `mini_assignment.py`.

Imagine you have a CSV file named `student_scores.csv` that contains data about students and their scores in different subjects. Your task is to perform data analysis and find the average score for each subject. Here's how you can approach this task:

1. Read the CSV file manually by splitting lines on commas.
2. Process each line to extract student information and scores.
3. Calculate the average score for each subject.
4. Display the results.
