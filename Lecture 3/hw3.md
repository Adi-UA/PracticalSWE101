## Section 2: Mini Assignment

Let's tie everything we've learned together by working on a practical example. This is also your mini assignment, so don't read the code section unless you want spoilers! Write the code in a file named `mini_assignment.py`.

Imagine you have a CSV file named `student_scores.csv` that contains data about students and their scores in different subjects. Your task is to perform data analysis and find the average score for each subject. Here's how you can approach this task:

1. Read the CSV file manually by splitting lines on commas.
2. Process each line to extract student information and scores.
3. Calculate the average score for each subject.
4. Display the results.
