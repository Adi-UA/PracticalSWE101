# Homework Assignment 3

## Objective

In this assignment, you will complete the Python code in `hw4a.py` and `hw4b.py` based on the concepts covered in the lecture. You will also need to ensure that all unit tests pass by running the provided test suite.

## Instructions

1. **Download the Starter File**:

   - Obtain the `hw4a.py` and `hw4b.py` files from the course repository.

2. **Complete the Code**:

   - Open the `hw4a.py` and `hw4b.py` files.
   - Implement the required functions and complete the code as instructed in the comments within the file.

3. **Run the Unit Tests**:

   - Ensure that all unit tests pass. The test cases are located in the same file.
   - You can run the tests using the following command:
     ```bash
     python hw4a.py
     ```
     ```bash
     python hw4b.py
     ```

4. **Submit Your Work**:
   - Once you have completed the code and verified that all tests pass, submit the `hw4a.py` and `hw4b.py` files.
