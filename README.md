# Practical Software Engineering 101 (in Python)

Welcome to Software Engineering 101! This course is designed to introduce you to the basics of programming using Python. Whether you're a complete beginner or have some experience with programming, this course will help you build a solid foundation in programming concepts and techniques. Go through the seconds from top to bottom in order including the projects to get the most out of this course.

This course will focus on practical programming skills that you can apply to real-world problems. You will learn how to write Python programs to solve various tasks, from simple calculations to more complex data processing and analysis.

## Section 1: Introduction to Python and Programming

In this section, you will learn the basics of Python programming, including variables, data types, operators, control structures, functions, data structures, and file handling. By the end of this section, you will be able to write simple Python programs to solve basic problems.

| Lecture                            | Description                            |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| [Lecture 1](Lecture%201/README.md) | Introduction to Python and Programming |
| [Lecture 2](Lecture%202/README.md) | Variables, Data Types, and Operators   |
| [Lecture 3](Lecture%203/README.md) | Control Structures and Functions       |
| [Lecture 4](Lecture%204/README.md) | Data Structures and File Handling      |
| [Lecture 5](Lecture%205/README.md) | Modules, JSON, and Web Requests        |

## Project 1:

Put everything you've learned in Section 1 to the test by building a weather forecast application that allows users to get current weather conditions and forecasts for a specific location using a weather API. This project will involve making API requests, processing JSON data, and presenting the information in a user-friendly way.

## Section 2: Recursion and an Introduction to Algorithms and Complexity Analysis

In this section, you will learn about recursion, a powerful programming technique for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller instances of the same problem. You will also be introduced to basic algorithms and data structures, such as searching and sorting algorithms, and their implementation in Python.

| TODO                               | Basic Time and Space Complexity    |

## Project 2:

Now that you know some complexity analysis and basic data structures like lists, dictionaries, and sets, it's time to put your skills to the test. In this project, you will complete a series of algorithm questions.

Complete all questions under Arrays and Hashing and Two Pointers on [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/roadmap). Turn in a pdf file with your solutions. For each problem, submit a screenshot of the problem, your submission on LeetCode, and a text explanation of the time and space complexity of the solution.

DO NOT look at the solutions on the website before submitting your solutions. After submitting your solutions, compare them with the solutions on the website and see if you can improve your solutions. If you have any questions about the problems, feel free to ask the instructor.
