# Practical Software Engineering 101

Welcome to Software Engineering 101! This course is designed to introduce you to the basics of programming using Python. While the majority of the course will focus on Python, the concepts you learn here will be applicable to other programming languages as well. In fact the challenge projects will require you to learn some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple web interface for the chatbot and image generation tool you will create.This will help make sure that the concepts you learn are transferrable to other programming languages. In the real world, SDEs are expected to learn new programming languages and technologies quickly as well!

Whether you're a complete beginner or have some experience with programming, this course will help you build a solid foundation in programming concepts and techniques. Go through the seconds from top to bottom in order including the projects to get the most out of this course.

This course will focus on practical programming skills that you can apply to real-world problems. You will learn how to write Python programs to solve various tasks, from simple calculations to more complex data processing and analysis. It is not meant to be a comprehensive guide to programming, but rather a hands-on introduction to programming concepts and techniques. At times it will be challenging, but the gol is to have you gain practical skills as quickly as possible. If you have any questions or need help, feel free to ask the instructor!

## Setup

1. Install Python: You can download Python from the official website [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to install the latest version of Python 3.x.
2. Install an IDE: You can use any text editor or IDE to write Python code. Some popular choices include Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, and Jupyter Notebook. We prefer Visual Studio Code for this course.
3. Install Git: You can download Git from the official website [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Git is a version control system that will help you manage your code and collaborate with others. In this course, we won't really use it except for downloading the course materials.
4. Clone this repository: You can clone this repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adi-UA/PracticalSWE101.git
```

## Section 1: Introduction to Python and Programming

In this section, you will learn the basics of Python programming, including variables, data types, operators, control structures, functions, data structures, and file handling. By the end of this section, you will be able to write simple Python programs to solve basic problems.

| Lecture                            | Description                            |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| [Lecture 1](Lecture%201/README.md) | Introduction to Python and Programming |
| [Lecture 2](Lecture%202/README.md) | Variables, Data Types, and Operators   |
| [Lecture 3](Lecture%203/README.md) | Control Structures and Functions       |
| [Lecture 4](Lecture%204/README.md) | Data Structures and File Handling      |
| [Lecture 5](Lecture%205/README.md) | Modules, JSON, and Web Requests        |

## Project 1 (Expected Time: 2 days):

Put everything you've learned in Section 1 to the test by building a weather forecast application that allows users to get current weather conditions and forecasts for a specific location using a weather API. This project will involve making API requests, processing JSON data, and presenting the information in a user-friendly way.

## Challenge Project 1: Clone GPT (Expected Time: < 1 Week):

Watch through [the following FreeCodeCamp video to get an introduction to HTML and CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLO4X_3VYdg). While javaScript is easily picked up if you know Python, HTML and CSS are a bit different. You will need to learn the basics of HTML and CSS to create a simple web interface for the chatbot you will create in this project.

Most of what you've learned in section 1 is transferable to other programming languages. In this project, you will learn how to use the OpenAI GPT-3 API to create a chatbot that can generate human-like text responses to user input.

Complete the Chat Completion Project 1 following [this FreeCodeCamp tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRQH2CFvedY). In this project you will be guided through the process of creating a chat GPT clone using the OpenAI GPT-3 API. You will also learn some basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple web interface for the chatbot. It is okay if you don't understand everything in the tutorial, but try to follow along and get the chatbot working. This will give you a taste of what is possible with programming and APIs. You are strongly encouraged to look up any concepts you don't understand and ask questions to the instructor.

## Challenge Project 2: Clone-E (Expected Time: < 1 Week):

Watch through [the following FreeCodeCamp video to get an introduction to HTML and CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLO4X_3VYdg). While javaScript is easily picked up if you know Python, HTML and CSS are a bit different. You will need to learn the basics of HTML and CSS to create a simple web interface for the image generation tool you will create in this project.

Complete the Image Generation Project 1 following [this FreeCodeCamp tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRQH2CFvedY). In this project you will be guided through the process of creating an image generation clone. Similar to the chatbot project, you will learn some basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple web interface for the image generation tool. It is okay if you don't understand everything in the tutorial, but try to follow along and get the image generation tool working. This will give you a taste of what is possible with programming and APIs. You are strongly encouraged to look up any concepts you don't understand and ask questions to the instructor.

## Section 2: Recursion and an Introduction to Algorithms and Complexity Analysis

In this section, you will learn about recursion, a powerful programming technique for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller instances of the same problem. You will also be introduced to basic algorithms and data structures, such as searching and sorting algorithms, and their implementation in Python.

| Lecture                            | Description                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| [Lecture 6](Lecture%206/README.md) | Recursion and Recursive Algorithms |
| TODO                               | Basic Time and Space Complexity    |

## Project 2:

Now that you know some complexity analysis and basic data structures like lists, dictionaries, and sets, it's time to put your skills to the test. In this project, you will complete a series of algorithm questions.

Complete all questions under Arrays and Hashing and Two Pointers on [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/roadmap). Turn in a pdf file with your solutions. For each problem, submit a screenshot of the problem, your submission on LeetCode, and a text explanation of the time and space complexity of the solution.

DO NOT look at the solutions on the website before submitting your solutions. After submitting your solutions, compare them with the solutions on the website and see if you can improve your solutions. If you have any questions about the problems, feel free to ask the instructor.
